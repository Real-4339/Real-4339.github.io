            This page is dedicated to my phone (Iphone Xr).
            Within this I will present the phone and its technical parameters,
            taking into account all factors
            which I encountered after months of use.

    <p><b>Apple iPhone XR</b> - A modern-featured smartphone with an iconic design, or as one might say = <b>a color experiment by Apple</b>,which was launched in 2018.
        In addition to the two expensive <b>XS and XS Max models</b>, <b>the iPhone XR</b> is a special attempt to introduce a more affordable apple smartphone, although even in the 256 GB version it exceeds the thousand-euro limit.
        You can find out more details about this facility on the individual subpages, and if you still have questions after reading my review, feel free to email me.
    </p>    
        <p>It starts at the price tag of <b> 869 </b> euros and makes the most sense as a 128 GB variation for <b> 929 euros </b>.
            However, for 949 euros you can have an <b> iPhone 8 Plus in the 256 GB version </b>, so I will <b> compare it with the iPhone XR </b>.
            By the way, try reading the XR other than ten-er, I'll say it straight, iks-er, and you'll immediately find out how many orthodox Apple fans you have around you. I am fascinated by how many people care about such nonsense.
      </p>
    <p>The question now remains whether the saving of the California <b>apple</b> can be felt adequately on the hardware. The answer to the question will be provided by this review, where I threw a eye on everything that is worth at least a little to mention.
        Most intergenerational changes occurred from a design point of view. Of course, better parts have been added, but this year is not about anything special, just a small evolution. The biggest innovations you can see on my website.
