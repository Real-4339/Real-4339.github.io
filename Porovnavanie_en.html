  <h1 class="h1_0">Apple iPhone XR - color experiment</h1>
  <br />
  <hr />
  <p>The iPhone XR is a special attempt to introduce alongside two expensive XS models
    and XS Max a more affordable apple smartphone, although it exceeds even in the 256 GB version
    thousand euros. It starts on a price tag of 869 euros and makes the most sense as
    128 GB variation for 929 euros.</p>
  <p>For 949 euros, however, you can have the iPhone 8 Plus in the 256 GB version, and therefore lower it
    We will compare several times with the new iPhone XR.</p>
  <p>By the way, try reading XR other than ten-er,
    I will say that iks-er, and you will immediately find out how many Orthodox Apple
    you have fans around you. I am fascinated by how many people care about such nonsense.</p>
  <br>

  <p>On smartphones and tablets, you can zoom in on all the pictures in the article
    with two fingers. You can click the image to bring it to the front on your computer
    and use the arrow keys on the keyboard to jump to the next one.</p>
   <p>At the beginning, I highly recommend you to read the review of the <u>iPhone XS</u> and <u>XS Max</u>.
    Expensive innovations, which bring mainly high performance, improved cameras,
    The XS Max is also the most powerful battery we've ever seen on an iPhone.
    However, endurance per charge is even more of the motto of the news tested today.
    XR after a long charge with the 1-amp charger in the package and even longer charging
    wirelessly (about five hours from zero to a hundred) lasts even more than
    record holders with attributes 8 Plus or XS Max. You can rely on two days of normal life
    use. In this respect, in addition to large iPhones, it has perhaps only two opponents
   - Huawei Mate 20 Pro with Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in a tight hinge.</p>   
 <br />
  <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/2p.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>We can immediately call it a very powerful smartphone with divine endurance on
    one charge, very good cameras for photos and video of which
    recording between smartphones is hard to find a competitor. The only question will be
    rough display with a distinctive frame around. And the necessary control of gestures, which
    you don't have to worry, but I don't know if this reassurance will be enough for you.
    But let's go pretty gradually.</p>
    <br />
    <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/4p.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
    <br />
   <p>First, open the <u>basic info of the iPhone XR</u>, where you will find all the verified ones
    parameters. We measured the dimensions, verified the weight, corrected the errors.</p>
   <p>And now we can name the basic differences of the new XR compared to the iPhone 8 Plus.
    In our opinion, it is a direct competitor and at the same time a predecessor of the XR model.</p>
      <br />
      <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art07.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
      <br />
    <p>A more powerful A12 processor made with 7 nm technology will ensure
      that even after two years you will have a top iPhone with quick reactions in your hands.
      Thanks to the relatively weak display, you can also count on high real performance
     - processor with redrawing 1.5 mil. points bother much less than with two
      millions of pixels of the Full Plus display of the 8 Plus model or even 3.3 million pixels
      on the XS Max screen.</p>
       <br />
       <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art08.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
       <br />
   <p>As I indicated, the 6.1 '' IPS display has a quarter lower resolution than the 5.5 ''
    Full HD screen of 7 Plus and 8 Plus models. In practice, this is no scary difference,
   but when I alternated at that time a two - hundred Xiaomi A2 Lite with a Full HD + display and this one
    four times more expensive iPhone, I always noticed a coarser raster XR.
    You will definitely not care if you use one mobile phone for a long time.</p>
  <p>By the way, I often work with screenshots, so I realize
    that I have a reflection instead of a 2 Mpix image with a 16: 9 ratio from the iPhone
    8 Plus after cropping to the same aspect ratio possible 1.3 Mpix image from iPhone XR.
   And that's a noticeable difference. But this is just such a small, apparently completely insignificant observation.</p>
   <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art12.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br />
  <p>Much more significant is the absence of 3D Touch - a feature that allows me
    Quickly jump to WiFi or Bluetooth settings by pressing the icon hard
    set or move the cursor like on the touchpad with a stronger finger press
    on the keyboard. Those who do not use 3D Touch will not miss it, but for me it is a big change.
    And I am convinced that there are more of us like that.</p>
   <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/12p.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br /> 
   <p>When comparing dimensions, the iPhone XR is 2 mm narrower and 7 mm lower than the 8 Plus or 7 Plus.
    In reality, therefore, it holds better, and this also applies to the mobile phone in the case. If you are looking for an executive,
    but a compact mobile phone, you better look for the XS model or the significantly cheaper iPhone 8.</p>
   <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art10.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br /> 
 <p>The weight of the mobile phone is also important. You will notice this, for example, when you hold your smartphone over your head for a long time
  evening or morning in bed. 194 grams is a few grams more than the 7 Plus and nine grams
  less than 8 Plus. In short, it's heavy weight, and definitely worth considering about 20 grams
   easier XS-ko.</p>
    <p>If you're switching to an iPhone XR from an older iPhone,
      you will enjoy not only higher performance, but also a new rear camera.
      It is one, but better usable. The main 12 Mpix camera
      namely, it offers a shorter focal length in all this year's iPhones,
      and only 25 mm. So far, all iPhones have had a focal length of 28 millimeters
      (after conversion to film). Images from XS, XS Max and XR are wider, more to do
      fits them from the same position as a photographer. And I really like that.</p>
    <br />
    <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art31.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
    <br /> 
  <p>Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X, XS and XS Max, the XR does not offer a second zoom camera.
    But you rarely used it when you zoomed in twice.
     Under normal circumstances, a cut-out from the main sensor is always used,
     only in very, very good light will the iPhone use the second camera.
      Its use is most often in portraits.</p>
  <p>However, the XR model can also handle them.
    And you don't even have to go further from the subject to get a double zoom.
    The disadvantage is that, for example, such an iPhone XS (Max) can beautifully blur the background
    also behind the scooter (see the <u>SXT Neo</u> review, in which all the images are created by the iPhone XS Max),
     which XR can't. Background blur is only possible with human portraits.</p>
   <p>The iPhone XR meets the highest demands,
    achieves even more success in video recording.
    The only drawbacks remain the camera settings only within the mobile phone settings and the ratio
    4: 3 pages that you cannot change. I don't understand why Apple is so stubborn in these things.</p>
   <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art35.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br /> 
   <p>I often change the fps of the video recording, because I don't have a lot of fun in the evening with 4K 60 fps.
    So I'm reducing it to 30 fps and turning on the new image cadence reduction feature at 24 fps at
     very low light conditions. Along with stereo sound, it is the largest photo / video
    advantages over older iPhones.</p>
   <p>A big change is the face unlock, which replaces the fingerprint on older models.
    Thanks to the infrared camera, it is reliable even at night, while this second camera is used
    even when blurring the background of self-portraits. So everything is as it should be.</p>
   <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art21.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br /> 
 <p>You pick up your mobile phone, it automatically lights up, it recognizes your face,
  you are currently reading notifications that are grouped, but for example emails
  you can see each one separately and then either turn on the flashlight, launch the camera
  (by pressing its icon or sliding it from the right side) or to jump by dragging your finger on
  home screen.</p>
  <p>In contrast to the iPhone 8 Plus, we also have face unlocking,
    also background blur for portraits taken with the front camera.
     Add to this the smaller focal length of the rear camera,
    video recording with stereo sound and better evening video shots, we realize
    that this is a big step forward from the capabilities of last year's iPhones.</p>
  <p>It's a pity that you only use about 70% of the narrow display when viewing photos,
    you can only see them on an area of ​​1104 x 828 pixels (0.91 Mpix), while on the iPhone 7 Plus
    or 8 Plus is photographed on the desktop 1440 x 1080 pixels (1.56 Mpix).</p>
  <br />
   <img style="width: 400px; border-radius: 6px;" src="Gif/Originals/art27.jpg" alt="image description" title="image tooltip"/>
   <br />
   <p>And that's 70% more for two years older and two hundred euros cheaper mobile
    (You can buy the iPhone 7 Plus in the 128 GB version for 749 euros). Larger area and more pixels
    You will appreciate not only viewing but also editing photos and videos.</p>
      <p>You may be missing a "button" with a fingerprint reader below the display,
        although I remembered him maybe once in a week. Hard to say,
        how are you. Gesture control is reliable and you don't have to worry about it.</p>
       <p>The narrower display brings restrictions not only when viewing photos,
        but also reading the text. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus / 8 Plus, it wraps by a few characters
      rather, the same paragraph review so it needs more lines and therefore you can see for longer
       screen mostly the same as on your older plus iPhone.
     In short, sometimes you see a little more on the display (facebook, web),
      sometimes, however, even that, and after opening a high-lying virtual keyboard
       the stretched display loses its meaning completely. I'm a little sorry.</p>
     <p>And even here I don't see a percentage of the battery, always to check its condition
      I need to download the control center from the top right corner or notification
      center from the left. And that's really unnecessarily impractical.</p>
   <p><u> The big advantage of XR is the availability not only in several color versions,
    but also with different storages - 64 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB. And just the golden middle
the path will probably often be the most suitable. XS or XS Max are for sale only
like the 64s, 256s and 512s, which is a shark pond with 128-gigabyte storage. </u></p>

  <h1 class="h1_0">Conclusion</h1>
  <br />
  <hr />
  <p>As critical as this article may seem, I like the iPhone XR.
    Finally, again a color-attractive mobile phone with abnormal performance, the best
    endurance not only among iPhones, but perhaps also all smartphones on the market,
    who is not afraid of water, you record top video with it, you shoot beautifully relatively
    Wide-angle shots with background blur behind people shot or back
    or front camera. I criticize the very poor use when flipping through the images
    narrow display, even for watching Full HD videos, I would rather choose an iPhone
    8 Plus, which is really a hundred cheaper than XR and brings several benefits.</p>
  <p>But, you crave that new iPhone with the display spilled all over
    front panel, you don't care about the finest display in the world,
    you should have had it in your XS or XS Max pocket for a long time. Do you want a modern design,
    nice colors, top performance, which will ensure flawless operation even by two -
    three years and you don't want to have any ordinary worries with your mobile. And in that case, take XR.
    An experiment that worked. I'm just sorry it doesn't have a Full HD + display.</p>
