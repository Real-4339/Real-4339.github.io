  <p>The user only has a <i> Face ID </i>, ie face recognition,
    which, however, does not matter at all. On the contrary, it works perfectly.
    In addition, using it is even <strong> more convenient </strong> than when we added it
    fingertip to the biometric sensor. Just look at your smartphone
    and in a split second you have it unlocked without being obstructed

    In some light conditions, it looks like it is black from
    more expensive <i> OLED </i> alternative, where the respective pixels are <strong> off </strong> during display.
    So it is very close to reality, although it is still <strong> backlit </strong>.</p>
  <p>The manufacturer thus tried to save costs and at the same time not lag too far
    behind the competition with the <i> Android </i> operating system, where <i> AMOLED </i> displays are a hit this year.",

    One is <i> True Tone </i> imaging technology, the other
    again a <strong> wide color range </strong>. When you combine them into one pile,
    an environmentally adaptable image is created in a colorful way,

   four times more expensive iPhone, I always noticed a coarser raster XR.
   You will definitely not care if you use one mobile phone for a long time.</p>
 <p>By the way, I often work with screenshots, so I realize
   that I have a reflection instead of a 2 Mpix image with a 16: 9 ratio from the iPhone
   8 Plus after cropping to the same aspect ratio possible 1.3 Mpix image from iPhone XR.

   evening or morning in bed. 194 grams is a few grams more than the 7 Plus and nine grams
   less than 8 Plus. In short, it's heavy weight, and definitely worth considering about 20 grams

     <p>If you're switching to an iPhone XR from an older iPhone,

       namely, it offers a shorter focal length in all this year's iPhones,
       and only 25 mm. So far, all iPhones have had a focal length of 28 millimeters

    only in very, very good light will the iPhone use the second camera.
     Its use is most often in portraits.</p>
 <p>However, the XR model can also handle them.
   And you don't even have to go further from the subject to get a double zoom.
   The disadvantage is that, for example, such an iPhone XS (Max) can beautifully blur the background
   also behind the scooter (see the <u>SXT Neo</u> review, in which all the images are created by the iPhone XS Max),
    which XR can't. Background blur is only possible with human portraits.</p>
  <p>The iPhone XR meets the highest demands,
   achieves even more success in video recording.

    very low light conditions. Along with stereo sound, it is the largest photo / video
   advantages over older iPhones.</p>
  <p>A big change is the face unlock, which replaces the fingerprint on older models.

   You will appreciate not only viewing but also editing photos and videos.</p>
     <p>You may be missing a 'button' with a fingerprint reader below the display,
       although I remembered him maybe once in a week. Hard to say,
       how are you. Gesture control is reliable and you don't have to worry about it.</p>
      <p>The narrower display brings restrictions not only when viewing photos,
       but also reading the text. Compared to the iPhone 7 Plus / 8 Plus, it wraps by a few characters
     rather, the same paragraph review so it needs more lines and therefore you can see for longer
      screen mostly the same as on your older plus iPhone.
    In short, sometimes you see a little more on the display (facebook, web),
     sometimes, however, even that, and after opening a high-lying virtual keyboard
      the stretched display loses its meaning completely. I'm a little sorry.</p>
    <p>And even here I don't see a percentage of the battery, always to check its condition

   Finally, again a color-attractive mobile phone with abnormal performance, the best
   endurance not only among iPhones, but perhaps also all smartphones on the market,
   who is not afraid of water, you record top video with it, you shoot beautifully relatively
   Wide-angle shots with background blur behind people shot or back
   or front camera. I criticize the very poor use when flipping through the images
   narrow display, even for watching Full HD videos, I would rather choose an iPhone
   8 Plus, which is really a hundred cheaper than XR and brings several benefits.</p>
 <p>But, you crave that new iPhone with the display spilled all over
   front panel, you don't care about the finest display in the world,
   you should have had it in your XS or XS Max pocket for a long time. Do you want a modern design,
   nice colors, top performance, which will ensure flawless operation even by two -
   three years and you don't want to have any ordinary worries with your mobile. And in that case, take XR.
   An experiment that worked. I'm just sorry it doesn't have a Full HD + display.",
